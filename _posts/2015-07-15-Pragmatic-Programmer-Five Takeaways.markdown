I just finished the book, "The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. The first sentence of the preface states, "This book will help you become a better programmer." I think it succeeds in this and I am not the only one as this book is on many programming reading lists.

The book covers many aspects of programming and related software endeavours and summarizes it's help through tips normally at the end of a topic. All in all, there are 70 tips and in this article, I'll be listing my personal top five that I will be working to incorporate into my daily work flow.

#### 1. Don't Live With Broken Windows

Inner cities are filled with mixes of nice, well maintained buildings and ones which are uninhabited and rotting. Researchers have studied this problem and determined that the main cause for to determine the outcome of a building is a broken window and the speed of it's fix. When something as small as a broken window goes unnoticed and is not fixed, this can lead to occupants showing less care and less timeliness in fixing of their own issues. This is a runaway effect and soon the building has went from one broken window to an entire building of uncleanliness and things in disrepair. 

The same thing happens in software. Small pieces of bad code, bad design, or wrong decisions slowly create software 'rot'. The psychology of programmers working on a project can quickly deteriorate upon seeing things like this. The thought of "Whoever wrote this didn't care, so why should I?" can slowly creep in. 

To combat this effect: Fix the bad code. If only it were that easy, right? If it's not as simple as fixing the problem when you see it, you can 'board it up'. Comment out the offending code, display a 'Not Implemented' message, or substitute dummy data instead. Many successful projects have been ruined by not following this rule.
